## Introduction

YesNoApp is a mobile application developed in Flutter that provides an offline chat experience. Users can send text messages through the application and, if a message contains a question mark at the end, it triggers a function that makes a call to an external API to get a "yes" or "no" response. The application has been created with the aim of practicing skills related to state management using the Provider package, model and class design, as well as the use of widgets for the user interface. Communication with an API for dynamic responses is also implemented.

## Technologies Used


The YesNoApp project has been developed using the following technologies:

Flutter: Flutter is an open source framework developed by Google that allows creating native iOS and Android applications from a single code base. It provides a large number of widgets and tools for fast and efficient development of mobile applications.

Dart: Dart is the programming language used by Flutter. It is a modern, object-oriented, statically typed language designed to create high-performance applications.

Provider: Provider is a state management package in Flutter that is used to efficiently share and manage data between different parts of the application. It enables simple and effective management of application state changes.
## Key functions

Offline Chat: The application allows users to send and receive text messages in an offline chat environment. Messages sent by users are stored locally in the application and displayed in the user interface.

Dynamic Responses: If a message sent by the user contains a question mark "?" at the end, the application makes an external API call to get a "yes" or "no" response. This feature adds an interesting and fun interaction to the chat.

State Management with Provider: The Provider package is used to manage the state of the application efficiently. This allows for seamless updating and synchronization of data throughout the user interface.

Model and Class Design: Models and classes have been designed to structure the data and facilitate the manipulation of messages and responses received from the API.
